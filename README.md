# Joshua's Career Expo App iOS

My first iOS App. I took advantage of the Fall 2015 Career Expo at Louisiana State University as an idea to start exploring the concepts of iOS development. I ended up with a working app that I used as my own reference as I navigated through the Fall 2015 Career Expo. I also was able to impress the recruiters with my app!

######It contained the following views:

* Companies 
  - A TableView list of companies I wanted to visit, their logo, and their booth number
  - **Note:** This view seem to have broken with the release of iOS 9
* Booth Map
  - A pinch-able zoomable map of the Career Expo Floor that included booth numbers
* Profile
  - A small profile page that gives a few details about myself
