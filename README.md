# Joshua's Career Expo App iOS

This is a simple iOS application I have developed as an opportunity to show case to the recruiters there.

######It contained the following views:

* Companies 
  - A list of companies I wanted to visit, their logo, and their booth number
* Booth Map
  - A pinch-able zoomable map of the Career Expo Floor that included booth numbers
* Profile
  - A small profile page that gives a few details about myself
